[{"content":"How I manage my tasks and time for both school and gamedev I\u0026rsquo;ve tried many ways to organize my work over my life, and today I will share a flexible yet thoughtful methodology. In my opinion at least.\nThe first step is to time block tasks. Time blocking means planning a task over a specific period of time.\nThe importance of time blocking is to not overbook yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s also a good practice for estimating workload, and measuring whether or not you\u0026rsquo;re late on your schedule on a daily basis.\nYou may ask: \u0026ldquo;Is that all?\u0026rdquo;.\nThe thing is, time blocking lacks flexibility. You have an urgency ? Poof, time blocking is cooked.\nIf you did time blocking well, you know how much time you want to work, and which tasks you want to do. Now, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter really much exactly when a task is completed usually.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when the serial planning becomes cereal instead. By taking into account mishaps.\nAlso, it lowers the tendency of the mind to over optimize your schedule for no reason. For me, it also feels more natural, as I find it stressful and non-natural to always follow strictly your schedule.\nSimply put, time blocking task gives you an overview of the workload at hand, and keeps you on track.\nBecause you can\u0026rsquo;t plan for everything, it\u0026rsquo;s better sometimes to approximately follow the schedule, and change the order of tasks.\nTLDR; Put the milk before the cereal.\n","date":"2025-05-17T21:47:24-04:00","permalink":"https://demo.stack.jimmycai.com/p/cereal-time-blocking-where-flexibility-meets-structure/","title":"Cereal Time Blocking: Where Flexibility Meets Structure"},{"content":"How the usage DA/SO can help your development process I frequently use Scriptable Objects in Unity and Data Assets in Unreal to help the design team.\nEssentially, instead of telling them to modify some variable in the code, I tell them to modify some variable in a specific file, either the DA or SO.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s nice for them because :\nIt\u0026rsquo;s way simpler. All related data are bundled together. They can make \u0026ldquo;backups\u0026rdquo; of the file in order to test new things and safely come back to the previous values. It\u0026rsquo;s nice for me because I can focus on developing new systems, and I can easily make changes to the codebase without worrying about the designers getting lost after all that Friday night refactoring.\nMy workflow goes on like this :\nFirst, I program the system. Then, I abstract the data used into a DA/SO. Finally, I explain to the designer where is the new DA/SO and what it is responsible for. It\u0026rsquo;s simple, and can have many advantages even for the gameplay itself. For example, you might want to have an easy or hard mode. Just make an easy and a hard SO/DA. Just feed the right data.\nIn that regard, I think it is a good first step into data driven gameplay, by enabling designers and artists to customize gameplay elements just by changing data.\n","date":"2025-05-06T12:21:27-04:00","permalink":"https://demo.stack.jimmycai.com/p/data-assets-and-scriptable-objects-as-first-stepping-stones-toward-data-oriented-development/","title":"Data Assets and Scriptable Objects as First Stepping Stones toward Data Oriented Development"},{"content":"About the Gamelab The Gamelab is essentially a game jam spanning across 10 weeks. Usually, a theme and 3 constraints are imposed on the contenders.\nEach team can have up to 8 members. Also, all the teams must be associated with a university in Québec (the province, not the city). Though members can be from other universities too, which is great !\nOn top of that, each team has two mentors who work at Ubisoft. Very useful.\nIn terms of scale, the 2025 Gamelab had 206 participants shared by 12 universities. The Gamelab ends with a boot, followed by a gala, where prizes based on 9 categories are given.\nMy 2024 participation I\u0026rsquo;ve participated in the 2024 and the 2025 edition of the Ubisoft Gamelab.\nMy university is not very gamedev oriented (even though things are getting better in that regard), and I basically learned about the 2024 Gamelab the same day the teams were required to be confirmed.\nIt was a butthead decision, but the teacher responsible for the process was super understanding. We were originally 3 when we talked to him. So I started my search for 5 other members.\nThe first 2 others were pretty easy to find, just two other (great) programmer friends. But now, I had to find artists and a designer.\nI was spamming emails all over the place. I was so lucky to stumble upon two great artists, and one nice designer.\nYou see, there isn\u0026rsquo;t a ton of game universities with a program specialized in video game art. It just so happened that the NAD was just in front of my university. It just so happened that a lot of people in this school want to do the UbiGamelab, but can\u0026rsquo;t (especially freshmen).\nThus, thee found the freshman art makers and the game designer. (he was from UQAT though, but the same logic applies).\nWe were very inexperienced and one of the constraints was to make a online multiplayer game. It was a grind, managing both finals and the last minute sprint to ship the game. It was more importantly a blast !\nWe did end up being nominated in the game design category, which was unexpected and very appreciated.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still very grateful to my team and my mentors for this journey.\nMy 2025 participation I got to be honest, the stars kind of aligned for me to participate in the 2025 edition. I was encouraged by my teacher, I had made a promise to another participant, and one of the artists, that I worked with during the 2024 edition, just came to me with 4 of his friends.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say that it was wayyyy easier to make a team this time. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to choose the programmers I was going to work with this time, and it was for the better. Both of them are great programmers, and I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I had the chance to work with such great teammates.\nThis time around though, we were balling. We chose Unreal 5 for our engine, as the artists were more used to it. The team had more overall gamedev and jams experience.\nIt ended up as a smoother and more productive process. We felt really proud about the artistic direction and the amount of polish we had achieved.\nDespite that, we sadly didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out to win. Let\u0026rsquo;s say it was more of a critical success than a commercial one.\nPositive outcomes You will make friends. Great friends. It\u0026rsquo;s a good opportunity to connect with current / future industry workers.\nNot only that, it\u0026rsquo;s not everyday we can work on a big project with specialized people as a student. Working alongside designers and artists is a very different (much better) experience.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s be honest, it kind of looks good on the resume. I think it has helped me to get into a master\u0026rsquo;s in game programming. A discussion for another time.\nIt is a learning opportunity, for both hard skills and soft skills.\nLastly, it is super fun.\nNegative outcomes The Gamelab is a huge time investment and it will impact your grades.\nIt can be very stressful at times, as y\u0026rsquo;all as a team are very likely to have some hurdles.\nBy the way, I don\u0026rsquo;t think the Gamelab is a good place to acquire new knowledge. It\u0026rsquo;s more appropriate to test the knowledge you already have. In short, I would advise against learning gamedev for the first time there.\nAdvice I think communication is key. As basic as it might sound, getting to know your colleagues before and during the competition will grease the engine.\nFor a less basic advice, the prototype is a way to communicate with your colleagues. Everybody will have an idea about how the game is, being able to test ideas and show some concrete examples will greatly help. Build often, and send it to everyone on the team. Test the game during your meeting.\nAs for the mentors, you should meet them at the same time. Each will bounce back on what the other said, and it will be more fruitful that way.\nScope management will hinder or bring your success. Be flexible, and pick your battle. Feedback is good based on the content and the timing of when it is given.\nMake a retrospective at the end of the project. You can do it on your own, but with your team it would be great. It is very educational, as you will get to know blind spots.\nIf possible, choosing one or two easier classes might help. You still have to be a full-time student to participate.\nConclusion I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to talk about such subjects, as not everybody knows about such events, or the possibility to make such events.\nI highly suggest anybody invested in gamedev to participate. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have something similar in your area, use the Gamelab as an example to your local companies ! Employees love to give back to the community, it\u0026rsquo;s great for the brand, and maybe it\u0026rsquo;s good to find new hires.\nHope it was a good read !\n","date":"2025-05-04T20:07:27-04:00","image":"https://demo.stack.jimmycai.com/p/what-is-the-ubisoft-gamelab-and-why-it-is-important./CUBI_Banner_hu_4f495ac1d3115d03.jpg","permalink":"https://demo.stack.jimmycai.com/p/what-is-the-ubisoft-gamelab-and-why-it-is-important./","title":"What is the Ubisoft Gamelab, and why it is important."},{"content":"Bonjour / Hi ! My name is Raphaël, and I\u0026rsquo;m currently finishing my CS degree at UQÀM.\nNot only have I always thought that blogs were couwl, I find gamedev related blogs and devlogs to be even couwler. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the many reasons pushing me to write markdown on a Tuesday night.\nThe thing is, I found there was a lack for a particular type of blog, then it was settled that I had to take care of the matter.\nWhat this blog is about ? The main topic of this blog is gamedev, more precisely gameplay programming.\nWe can find a lot of blogs about many topics in gamedev, but I found it way too hard to look for blogs centered around gameplay programming, despite being one of the most important pillars in game development.\nAlso, I found that most bloggers were super experienced principal experts, which I love.\nBut, I also think that having a blog hosted by another upcoming dev, dealing with both studies and game development could be a nice refresher.\nTLDR; gameplay programming with a little sugarcoat of slice of life and fun gaming facts.\nMy game projects Classified from the most recent to the oldest.
