# How I manage my tasks and time for both school and gamedev

I've tried many ways to organize my work over my life, and today I will
share a flexible yet thoughtful methodology. _In my opinion at least._

The first step is to time block tasks.
Time blocking means planning a task over a specific period of time.

The importance of time blocking is to **not overbook** yourself. It's also
a good practice for **estimating** workload, and **measuring** whether or not you're
late on your schedule on a daily basis.

You may ask: "Is that all?".<br>
The thing is, time blocking lacks flexibility. You have an urgency ?
**Poof**, time blocking is cooked.

If you did time blocking well, you know how much time you want to work, and
which tasks you want to do. Now, it doesn't matter really much **exactly**
when a task is completed _usually_.

That's when the serial planning becomes **cereal** instead. By taking into account
_mishaps_.

Also, it lowers the tendency of the mind to over optimize your
schedule for no reason. For me, it also feels more natural, as I find it
stressful and non-natural to **always** follow strictly your schedule.

Simply put, time blocking task gives you an overview of the workload at hand, and keeps you on track.<br>
Because you can't plan for everything, it's better sometimes to approximately follow the schedule, and change the order of tasks.

TLDR; Put the milk before the cereal.
